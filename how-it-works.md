<h3>Our Process</h3>

<p>We have a very simple process. You simply sign up online, and our designers get to work with the information you've provided. They may need to contact you in order to clarify your requirements, but once we have everything we will start work.</p>

<p>Once the design is complete, we will send it over to you for review. We allow for two round of amendments, so you get two chances to tweak things exactly to your liking before we start the build.</p>

<p>With the design agreed, our developers will start building your website. This can take between 1-3 weeks depending on the package you've selected - but our aim is to finish and have everything live on a domain of your chosing within your first 30 days.</p>

<h3>Payment</h3>

<p>We ask for your first months payment in advance, to enable our deigners to get to work on your website straight away. This also means if you'd like to cancel with us at any time, you can do quickly and easily. We don't lock you in to a notice period or anything like that.</p>

<h3>Ownership</h3>

<p>The content of your website 100% belongs to you, and is easily exportable at the click of a button. The design and code belongs to us so if you wish at any point to take this elsewhere you'll need to contact us.</p>
